# Inspire


How have you acted as an agent of change to inspire and influence your peers? Please detail a specific example.

Yes, I do motivate and inspire my friends. My most important quality is that I always take a stand for myself. I have a simple life. And my aim is to make my friends and colleagues realize that life is simple. Every day just by doing meditation and exercise, our mind and body become energetic. I keep on doing daily. I do something or another which pushes me towards my career on a small scale. I strongly believe in consistency. My perseverance is the proof that I inspire and influence my friends.
